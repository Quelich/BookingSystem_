# What I learned
+ File Operations: Write, Read, Save
+ Exception handling caused by the specified operating systems and the mismanagement of directories
+ Interacting with the libraries like Time, Stdlib, Stdbool to efficiently address the problems
+ Still a long way to write clear code :D 
+ Low-level programming concepts that I have been using while writing faster applications in C#, which is a modern programming language 0_0
